### **Brief About the Prototype**

**(Slide 2)**

**Title: What We've Built**

*   **What it is:** An AI-powered platform that acts as a co-pilot for early-stage investors, automating the process of startup evaluation.
*   **What it does:** It ingests unstructured data — pitch decks, call transcripts, financial statements — and transforms it into concise, actionable investment insights.
*   **The Goal:** To help investors make faster, smarter, and more data-driven investment decisions.

### **The Opportunity: The Problem & Our Solution**

**(Slide 3)**

**Title: Drowning in Data, Starving for Insights**

**The Problem:**

*   Early-stage investors are overwhelmed with unstructured data.
*   Traditional analysis is slow, manual, and inconsistent.
*   Valuable insights are often missed, and red flags are overlooked.

**Our Solution:**

*   An AI analyst that automates the entire evaluation process.
*   It reads, understands, and analyzes all the documents for a deal.
*   It benchmarks the startup against its peers and flags potential risks.
*   It generates a comprehensive, yet easy-to-digest, deal note in minutes, not days.

### **The Opportunity: Our Differentiation & USP**

**(Slide 4)**

**Title: The Unfair Advantage: A Hybrid AI-Analytics Engine**

**How We're Different:**

*   **Multi-Agent System:** We use a team of specialized AI agents, orchestrated by Agent Builder, that work together like a real analyst team.
*   **Hybrid Approach:** We combine Generative AI (with Gemini) for qualitative analysis with BigQuery for quantitative benchmarking.
*   **Semantic Search:** We use Vertex AI Vector Search to find a startup's *true* peer group, going beyond simple industry classifications.

**Our Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**

*   **Speed & Scale:** Evaluate a startup in minutes, not days.
*   **Data-Driven Insights:** Recommendations are always backed by data, with clear benchmarks and risk assessments.
*   **Personalized Analysis:** Investors can tailor the analysis to their own preferences.
