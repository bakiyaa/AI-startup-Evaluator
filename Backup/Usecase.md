# Use Case: AI-Powered Startup Analyst

## 1. Challenge

Early-stage investors often drown in unstructured startup data — pitch decks, founder calls, emails, and scattered news reports. Traditional analysis is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to missing red flags. What’s needed is an AI analyst that can cut through the noise, evaluate startups like a trained associate, and generate investor-ready insights at scale.

## 2. Objective

Build an AI-powered analyst that reviews founder material and public data to create concise, actionable deal notes with clear benchmarks and risk assessments across sectors and geographies.

## 3. Solution Capabilities

*   **Ingest Data:** Ingest pitch decks, call transcripts, founder updates, emails, and other documents (PDF, DOCX, voice, video) via a user-friendly UI.
*   **Benchmark Startups:** Benchmark startups against sector peers using financial multiples, hiring data, and traction signals from public data and dedicated datasets in BigQuery.
*   **Flag Risks:** Flag potential risk indicators like inconsistent metrics, inflated market size, or unusual churn patterns.
*   **Generate Recommendations:** Summarize growth potential and generate investor-ready recommendations tailored to customizable weightages.

## 4. The Analyst Lifecycle

The platform will follow a dynamic, multi-stage process to analyze a startup:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** The user uploads founder materials (pitch deck, emails, voice/video notes, etc.) and provides key deal information via the UI. The system uses **Cloud Vision API** for OCR and **Speech-to-Text** to transcribe audio and video.
2.  **Initial Analysis & Gap Analysis:** The AI performs an initial analysis of the provided materials to extract key information and identify any critical information gaps.
3.  **Optional: AI-Powered Information Augmentation:** If there are information gaps, the system can, with the user's approval, generate a **Google Form** with specific questions to send to the founder to gather the missing data.
4.  **Deep Dive Analysis:** The core analysis is performed using a hybrid approach:
    *   **Peer Group Identification:** **Vertex AI Vector Search** is used to perform a semantic search on unstructured deal notes to find the startup's true peer group.
    *   **Quantitative Benchmarking:** **BigQuery** is used to perform fast and efficient benchmark calculations on the AI-curated peer group.
    *   **Qualitative Analysis:** The **Gemini API** is used to analyze the startup's strengths and weaknesses across various criteria.
5.  **Risk Analysis:** The system analyzes the deal notes to identify and score potential risks, which are then visualized in a **Risk Heatmap**.
6.  **Interactive Q&A:** The user can interact with an **AI Assistant** (powered by Agent Builder) to ask natural language questions about the analysis and delve deeper into the data.
7.  **Scenario Comparison & Recommendation:** The user can adjust the **weightages** of different evaluation criteria (e.g., team, product, market), and the system will generate a new, personalized recommendation.
8.  **Generate Report:** The AI generates a final, structured deal note.
9.  **Decision & Tracking:** The user makes the final "Invest," "Pass," or "Monitor" decision, which is logged by the system.
