# Configuration and Setup Guide

This document outlines the necessary configurations and updates required to run the AI-startup-Evaluator application fully.

## Implemented Use Cases

The application frontend suggests the following use cases:

*   **File Upload:** Allows users to upload documents related to a startup.
*   **Financial Revenue Forecast:** A section for analyzing and forecasting financial revenue.
*   **Risk Analysis:** A section for analyzing potential risks.
*   **Deal Notes:** A section for taking notes on a deal.

**Completion Status:**

*   **File Upload:** Partially implemented. The frontend allows file uploads, and the backend saves the file. However, the core AI processing logic is missing.
*   **Financial Revenue Forecast, Risk Analysis, Deal Notes:** These are currently UI components only. There is no backend logic to support their functionality.

## Backend Configuration and Updates

The backend (`app.py`) requires significant development to become fully functional.

### 1. AI Model Integration

The core logic for processing the uploaded files with your AI models is missing. In `app.py`, you need to replace the placeholder comment with your own code:

```python
# Here you would process the file with your AI model
```

This will involve:

*   Loading your trained AI models.
*   Preprocessing the uploaded file data.
*   Running the data through your models to get evaluation results.
*   Returning the results to the frontend.

### 2. Secure File Uploads

The current file upload mechanism is insecure. You should modify the `upload_file` function in `app.py` to:

*   Generate a secure filename for each uploaded file.
*   Save files to a designated and secure uploads folder.

### 3. Implement Backend for Other Use Cases

You need to create new Flask routes and logic in `app.py` to support the other use cases:

*   **Financial Revenue Forecast:** Create an endpoint that takes financial data and returns a forecast.
*   **Risk Analysis:** Create an endpoint that takes relevant data and returns a risk analysis.
*   **Deal Notes:** Create endpoints to save, retrieve, and update deal notes.

### 4. Production Settings

For a production environment, you should disable debug mode in `app.py`:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=False)
```

## Frontend Updates

The frontend components (`FinancialRevenueForecast.js`, `RiskAnalysis.js`, `DealNotes.js`) will need to be updated to communicate with the new backend endpoints you create. This will involve:

*   Making API calls to the backend.
*   Displaying the results received from the backend.
